# My Neovim Dotfiles

Template based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim). Changes include a new alpha.nvim homescreen and support for hardware development/flashing. Currently writing a less cluttered set of dotfiles based on kickstart.nvim to make maintaining this thing less of a pain in the ass.

Refer to the [LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
